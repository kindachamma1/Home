      <h2>Featured Experiences</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Here are some highlights from recent academic and professional events I‚Äôve participated in.</p>

      <!-- Summer School in Vlora -->
      <div class="article" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
        <h3>üåû EMSSE Summer School ‚Äì Vlora, Albania</h3>
        <p>
          During the first year of my master‚Äôs program, I had the opportunity to attend the very first <strong>EMSSE Summer School</strong> in beautiful Vlora, Albania. The sessions were quite different from our usual lectures, but equally valuable ‚Äî offering a more hands-on and communication-centered approach to learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          One highlight was the lecture by <strong>Prof. Valentina Tirloni</strong> on <em>‚ÄúCommunication Tools‚Äù</em>. It made me realize how many practices we tend to take for granted when presenting ideas ‚Äî and how many of those aren't necessarily the most effective. Her insights helped reshape how I now approach presentations and audience engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also explored technical themes such as <strong>solar energy</strong>, and concluded the school by delivering presentations on topics of our choice, where we applied the communication strategies we had just learned. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academics, the event was meaningful on a personal level ‚Äî reuniting with classmates from different paths of the EMSSE program and sharing diverse cultural and academic perspectives made it a memorable end to the year.
        </p>

      <!-- IEEE Conference in Tirana -->
      <div class="article">
        <h3>üì° IEEE SoSE 2025 ‚Äì Systems Engineering for Sustainable Development</h3>
        <p>
          I had the privilege of attending the <strong>IEEE 20th Annual System of Systems Engineering Conference (SoSE)</strong> in <strong>Tirana</strong>, where the main theme was <em>Systems Engineering for Sustainable Development</em>. It was an intellectually stimulating experience that opened my eyes to several fascinating frontiers.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>üöó Systems Engineering & Autonomous Vehicles</strong><br>
            <em>Dr. Ibanez-Guzman (Renault SAS)</em> presented groundbreaking ideas about the complexity of autonomous systems ‚Äî from navigation to pedestrian behavior prediction and localized testing. A powerful insight: <em>navigation systems must adapt drastically between cities like Berlin and Hanoi.</em>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>üíª Mainframe in the AI Age</strong><br>
            <em>Sir Fabio Riva (IBM)</em> discussed how mainframes still power over 60% of global financial transactions. One astonishing fact: IBM mainframes can withstand an <strong>8.3 magnitude earthquake</strong>! This was followed by <em>Francesca Ferretti</em>'s talk, who compared IBM Z‚Äôs power to Instagram‚Äôs ‚Äî <strong>over 1.1 million secure transactions per second vs. 1,200 posts</strong>. It sparked my interest in <strong>quantum-safe mainframes</strong>.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>üå± Biomimicry: Nature-Inspired Innovation</strong><br>
            <em>Prof. Mauro Gallo</em> delivered a talk that deeply resonated with me. He explored <em>biomimicry</em> ‚Äî drawing from nature to build sustainable technologies. The highlight was the <strong>Flappy Project</strong>, which uses insect-like robots to assist in agriculture. I realized I had encountered such concepts before but never had the language to describe them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This conference left a lasting impression and introduced me to new paths I‚Äôm now excited to explore ‚Äî especially in the intersection between sustainability and advanced system design.
